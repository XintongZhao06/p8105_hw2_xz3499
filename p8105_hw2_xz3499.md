## Problem 1

### 1. Load required libraries

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

### 2. Load the dataset

``` r
pols_month <- read_csv("fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv")
snp <- read_csv("fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv")
unemployment <- read_csv("fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv")
```

### 3. Clean the data in pols-month.csv

``` r
# quickly view the data
glimpse(pols_month)
```

    ## Rows: 822
    ## Columns: 9
    ## $ mon      <date> 1947-01-15, 1947-02-15, 1947-03-15, 1947-04-15, 1947-05-15, …

``` r
pols_clean <- pols_month %>% 
  separate(mon, 
           into = c("year","month","day"),
           sep = "-"
           ) %>% 
  mutate(
    month = as.numeric(month),
    month = month.name[month],
    year = as.numeric(year),
    day = as.numeric(day)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(president = ifelse(prez_gop == 1, "gop", "dem")) %>% 
  select(-prez_gop, -prez_dem, -day)

view(pols_clean)
```

### 4. Clean the data in snp.csv

``` r
# quickly view the data
glimpse(snp)
```

    ## Rows: 787
    ## Columns: 2
    ## $ date  <chr> "7/1/15", "6/1/15", "5/1/15", "4/1/15", "3/2/15", "2/2/15", "1/2…

``` r
snp_clean <-snp %>% 
  separate(date, 
           into = c("month","day","year"),
           sep = "/"
           ) %>% 
  mutate(
    month = as.numeric(month),
    month = month.name[month],
    year = as.numeric(year),
    year = ifelse(year < 50, 2000 + year, 1900 + year),
    day = as.numeric(day)
  ) %>% 
  select(year, month, close) %>% 
  arrange(year, month)
  
view(snp_clean)
```

### 5. Tidy the unemployment data

``` r
unemployment_clean <- unemployment %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = Jan : Dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment_rate"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    month = case_when(
      month == "Jan" ~ "January",
      month == "Feb" ~ "February",
      month == "Mar" ~ "March",
      month == "Apr" ~ "April",
      month == "May" ~ "May",
      month == "Jun" ~ "June",
      month == "Jul" ~ "July",
      month == "Aug" ~ "August",
      month == "Sep" ~ "September",
      month == "Oct" ~ "October",
      month == "Nov" ~ "November",
      month == "Dec" ~ "December"
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(year = Year, month, unemployment_rate) %>% 
  arrange(year, month)

view(unemployment_clean)
```

### 6. Join the datasets

``` r
merged_data <- left_join(pols_clean, snp_clean, by = c("year","month"))
final_data <- left_join(merged_data, unemployment_clean, by= c("year","month"))

view(final_data)
```

### 7. Description

- The **“pols_clean”** dataset contains monthly data related to American
  politics, spanning from 1947 to 2015, with a total of 822 rows of
  observational data. It specifically includes the number of Democratic
  and Republican politicians (including governors, senators and
  representatives) at different times, as well as the party information
  of the president. The key variables include the number of Republican
  governors (`gov_gop`), the number of Republican senators (`sen_gop`),
  the number of Republican representatives (`rep_gop`), the number of
  Democratic governors (`gov_dem`), the number of Democratic senators
  (`sen_dem`), the number of Democratic representatives (`rep_dem`), and
  the presidential party (`president`).

- The **“snp_clean”** dataset contains monthly closing price data of the
  S&P index, spanning from 1950 to 2015, with a total of 787 rows of
  observational data. The key variable is the closing price (`close`).

- The **“unemployment_clean”** dataset contains monthly unemployment
  rate data in the United States, spanning from 1948 to 2015, with a
  total of 816 rows of observational data. The key variable is the
  unemployment rate (`unemployment_rate`).

- **“final_data”** contains all the information of the above three
  datasets, including 11 variables and 822 rows of observational data,
  spanning from 1947 to 2015. It provides a reference basis for
  analyzing the historical development of the United States from three
  dimensions: politics, economy, and employment. Due to the inconsistent
  time spans of various datasets, there are some missing values after
  merging.

## Problem 2

### 1. Load required libraries

``` r
library(readxl)
```

### 2. Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet

``` r
#specify the sheet in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries
mr_trash <- read_excel("202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", skip = 1, range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
  #use reasonable variable names
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  #omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data
  filter(!is.na(dumpster)) %>% 
  #round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer and converts the result to an integer variable
  mutate(
    sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls)),
    year = as.character(year)
    ) %>% 
  #add an additional variable to keep track of which Trash Wheel is which
  mutate(trash_wheel = "Mr. Trash Wheel") %>% 
  select(trash_wheel,everything())

view(mr_trash)
```

### 3. Read and clean the Professor Trash Wheel sheet

``` r
professor_trash <- read_excel("202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", skip = 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(!is.na(dumpster)) %>%
  mutate(
    trash_wheel = "Professor Trash Wheel",
    year = as.character(year)
    ) %>% 
  select(trash_wheel,everything())

view(professor_trash)
```

### 4. Read and clean the Gwynnda Trash Wheel sheet

``` r
gwynnda_trash <- read_excel("202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel", skip = 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(!is.na(dumpster)) %>%
  mutate(
    trash_wheel = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel",
    year = as.character(year)
    ) %>% 
  select(trash_wheel,everything())

view(gwynnda_trash)
```

### 5. Combine these datasets to produce a single tidy dataset

``` r
combined_trash <- bind_rows(mr_trash, professor_trash, gwynnda_trash) %>%
  #make sure the date format is consistent
  mutate(date = as.Date(date))

view(combined_trash)
```

### 6. Description

- The above three datasets record the garbage collection situations of
  three garbage collection boats (Mr. Trash Wheel, Professor Trash Wheel
  and Gwynnda) in the Inner Harbor of Baltimore. The merged dataset
  contains a total of 1033 observations, and each observation represents
  a trash can collection record. The key variables include the
  `trash_wheel` identification of the garbage collection vessel, the
  `dumpster` number, the collection `date`, the `weight_tons` weight of
  the garbage, and the `volume_cubic_yards` volume. Unit: cubic yards),
  quantities of various types of garbage (such as plastic bottles
  `plastic_bottles`, `polystyrene`, cigarettebutts `cigarette_butts`,
  glass bottles `glass_bottles`, plastic bags `plastic_bags`, packaging
  bags `wrappers`, etc.) And the number of households powered based on
  garbage weight calculation (`homes_powered`).

- According to the available data, the total weight of the garbage
  collected by Professor Trash Wheel was 246.74 tons. The total number
  of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in June 2022 was 1.812^{4}.
